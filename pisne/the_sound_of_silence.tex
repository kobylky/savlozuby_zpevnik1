\beginsong{The Sound of Silence}[by={Paul Simon}]

\beginverse

\[Ami]Hello darkness, my old \[G]friend,
I've come to talk with you \[Ami]again,
because a \[C]vision softly \[F]cree\[C]ping,
left its seeds whele I was \[F]sleep\[C]ing
and the \[F]vision that was planted in my \[C]brain
still re\[Ami]mains \[C]with in the \[G]sound of \[Ami]silence.
\endverse

\beginverse
\chordsoff
\[Ami]In restless dreams I walked \[G]alone
narrow streets of cobble\[Ami]stone,
'Neath the \[C]halo of a \[F]street \[C]lamp,
I turn my collar to the \[F]cold and \[C]damp
When my \[F]eyes were stebbed by the flash of a neon \[C]light
that split the \[Ami]night \[C]and touched the \[F]Sound of \[Ami]Silence.
\endverse

\beginverse
\chordsoff
\[Ami]And in the naked light I \[G]saw
ten thousend people, maybe \[Ami]more.
People \[C]talking without \[F]spea\[C]king,
people hearing without \[F]listen\[C]ing,
peolple \[F]writing songs that voices never \[C]share
and no one \[Ami]dare \[C]disturb the \[G]Sound of \[Ami]Silence.
\endverse

\beginverse
\chordsoff
\[Ami] "Fool!" said I, "You do not \[G]know
silence like a cancer \[Ami]grows."
"Hear my words that \[C]I might \[F]teach \[C]You,
Take my arms that I might \[F]reach \[C]You."
But my \[F]words like silent raindrops \[C]fell,
\[Ami]and \[C]echoed in the \[G]wells of \[Ami]silence.
\endverse

\beginverse
\chordsoff
\[Ami]And the people bowed and \[G]prayed
to the neon god they \[Ami]made.
And the sight flashed \[C]out its \[F]warn\[C]ing,
in the words that it was \[F]form\[C]ing
and the sight said "The \[F]words of prophets are written on subway \[C]walls
and tenement \[Ami]halls" and \[C]whisper'd in The \[G]Sound of \[Ami]Silence.
