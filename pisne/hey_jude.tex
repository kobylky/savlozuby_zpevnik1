Hey \[C]Jude don't make it \[G]bad,

then you can \[G7]start to make it \[C]better.

Hey Jude don't be afraid,
you were made to go out and get her,
the minute you let her under your skin
then you begin to make it better.

\[C7]And any time you feel the \[F]pain, hey \[F/E]Jude, ref\[Dmi7]rain,
don't \[Dmi7/C]carry the \[G7/C#]world \[G7]upon your \[C]shoulders,
\[C7]for well you know that it's a \[F]fool who \[F/E]plays it \[Dmi7]cool
by \[Dmi7/C]making his \[G7/C#]world a \[G7]little \[C]colder,

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
